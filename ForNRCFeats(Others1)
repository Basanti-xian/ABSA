build routes is dependent on the data staying in the sheet to determine if deals have changed.^Business^0
the goal of this application is to allow you to set your excel worksheets aside and work strictly within pre-schedule workspace (psw).^Power scheduling task^0

"since ""buildroute"" has been, and will be, a fundamental part of east scheduling we agreed that the new version should save in the same manner it does now, nothing more.thanks,corry"^Power scheduling task^0
let me know if you are still having trouble pulling up deals for palo.regards,will^Business^-1
also, you should be able to run the application in any terminal server environment.i verified that i could pull up a mass of deals for palo verde and june .^Business^1
this is to protect against deals being pulled in a second time and being accidentally duplicated in the workspace.^Business^1

here's my first cut..  enpower deal scheduling.^Power scheduling task^0
can you give asem and me some deal numbers to look into regarding the northwest delivered deals with multiple delivery points?.^Business^0
"then (whenever the ""next"" modification was implemented), they would add the capability to interact with enpower deals (ie write notes to the deal record and then, provide an entry point for deal entry for new deals done).the east group does not need to see por/pod in the path for ""transmission."""^Business^0
"enron needs to be shown as ""bookends"" on the transmission we use, or else it could be misconstrued as a purchase or sale.some really long paths might show better in line view if that could auto-size verticallywhen i try to cut a particlar path, the action of the entire path cut screen coming up and then me having to choose new path cut totally blocks my view of the existing path i am trying to deal with."^Company^0
you can either test it in either of the test environments (pwrtestn or pwrtestp) or you can have mike tully create a temporary short-cut for you so you can run the report against production data.thanks,  poston^Energy^0

as far as the new scheduling fee, i'm being told that we're still negotiating a way to enter this into enpower.^Power scheduling task^0
the carp it people : hmmmm i don't know if they exist  - i got a kick out of that one!yes i do have a call into it - they are working on a solution for carp.in the meantime when dealing with a monthly demand charge - make sure only one strip contains the demand charge.the reason we had the problem with april is because the system automatically created the  strips due to the time change.so to avoid any problems until this has been fixed - if you have a deal with multiple strips - and have a monthly demand charge / mw,make sure only one strip has the demand charge price entered.i will keep you updated on this issue.let me know if you have any additional questions.-heather^Finance^0
