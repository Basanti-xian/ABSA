after discussing the matter with stacey white, she recommended entering the new deals in enpower as zero price, non mtm, with an annuity equal to the prepay amount.we should enter notes into enpower indicating that these are prepay transactions.this will allow settlements to match an annuity in enpower with prepay out the door.^Finance^0
if you have any questions or modifications please me an e-mail or give me a call.cash deskeach cash desk needs to identify all transactions in its region that have not been terminated.on a counterparty by delivery point basis we need to assess whether the weighted average of all near term (next day to next week) deliveries with that counterparty are in the money.if the average of all transactions with that counterparty at a given location are in the money, we should submit a request for and endeavor to serve the entire portfolio of deals with that counterparty at that delivery point.^Business^0
our counterparties have no motivation to terminate our contracts because such a termination would force them to write us a substantial check.^Business^1
