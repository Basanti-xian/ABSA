good morning,my target testing date today is june th,  i am running in test p in local enpower using actual data from our scheduling sheets re-arranged to meet the new guidelines.the daily deals i coded x in columns j and n,  the month long bookouts and bom bookouts i coded r. what worked:i was able to retrieve my saved workspace with all data intact.^Business^0
a check of deals actually scheduled vs. build route results showed that all deals were extracted correctly from enpower.^Business^0
multiple sorting will contunue to be done in excel, or we can do a series of single sorts in the psw to acheive the same result.routing deals: will had deleted all routes for june th, starting me with a clean slate.^Business^0
the deals that were not routed appear to be due to a user error of deal number duplication in the sheet.^Business^0
most routing was done, and a spot check of deals shows that they were routed properly.^Business^1
this routing was very easy, a large point with on peak non shaped deals only.things i did not expect that i liked:when i highlight a group of cells in build route, it stays highlighted when i move up to the scheduling sheet to highlight a comparison group of cells.^Business^1
this current speed will not be sufficient to work in production.^Energy^-1
the improvement we are expecting to see is the app should not duplicate deal strips on dates that have no physical power flow.^Energy^0
i had difficulty checking the routing results, as i kept getting bde errors in scheduling after routing had occurred (local enpower).^Power scheduling task^-1
